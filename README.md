</div>

### Description

I made this code becuase I am fascinated by the art of customization. In K-bots you can create your own bot and fight against your friend in a text based arena.
 
### More Info
 
I would read the help files that are built into the code to understand what the game is about.

May be a few bugs while fighting. I fbugs are encountered please e-mail them to me at adam@caimen.net
